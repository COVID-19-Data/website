        The COVID-19 Data Repository is a data repository that contains all
        kinds of information available about the COVID-19 virus, we gather,
        sanitize, normalize & categorise data daily from sources like NGO's and
        Governments, to make them available for research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 virus is spreading at an alarming rate and the global
        medical community is still trying to get a grasp on what exactly is
        needed to fight this disease and prepare for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        People in the medical world are asking the tech community for help to
        provide solutions. The way we're trying to help is to make sure that all
        the data that is there is available in easy ways for research. We're
        trying do this in a few diferent ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect all the data from sources like NGO's and governments</li>
        <li>Validate, sanitize & normalize the data</li>
        <li>Categorise the data and create useable datasets for research</li>
        <li>Make the data available for download or trough API</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Feel free to reach out if you want to contribute, learn more or help in
        any other way. We have a slack channel for everyone interested in
        joining.
      </p>
